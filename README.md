# 98point6_Drop_Token

## Rules of the Game
Drop Token takes place on a 4x4 grid. A token is dropped along a
column and said token goes to the lowest unoccupied
row of the board. A player wins when they have 4 tokens next to each
other either along a row, in a column, or on a diagonal. If the board is
filled, and nobody has won then the game is a draw. Each player takes
a turn, starting with player 1, until the game reaches either win or
draw.

## Game Flow
User can set either player's name, role (human/computer), and token
(classic red/blue or custom by upload a image from gallery). Player 1
will always go first. Once "start game" button is clicked, game will
start with current configuration. User can restart a new game with
current configuration when a game is finished or click "back" button to
reconfigure.
